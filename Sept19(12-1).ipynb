hay in the barn,\\n\\n  The sound of the belchâ€™d words of my voice loosâ€™d to the eddies of\\n      the wind,\\n  A few light kisses, a few embraces, a reaching around of arms,\\n  The play of shine and shade on the trees as the supple boughs wag,\\n  The delight alone or in the rush of the streets, or along the fields\\n      and hill-sides,\\n  The feeling of health, the full-noon trill, the song of me rising\\n      from bed and meeting the sun.\\n\\n  Have you reckonâ€™d a thousand acres much? have you reckonâ€™d the earth much?\\n  Have you practisâ€™d so long to learn to read?\\n

withdraws at the peep of the day with stealthy tread,\\n  Leaving me baskets coverâ€™d with white towels swelling the house with\\n      their plenty,\\n  Shall I postpone my acceptation and realization and scream at my eyes,\\n  That they turn from gazing after and down the road,\\n  And forthwith cipher and show me to a cent,\\n  Exactly the value of one and exactly the value of two, and which is ahead?\\n\\n       4\\n  Trippers and askers surround me,\\n  People I meet, the effect upon me of my early life or the ward and\\n      city I live in, or the nation,\\n  The latest dates, discoveries, inventions, societies, authors old and new,\\n  My dinner, dress, associates, looks, compliments, dues,\\n  The real or fancied indifference of some man or woman I love,\\n  The sickness of one of my folks or of myself, or ill-doing or loss\\n      or lack of money, or depressions or exaltations,\\n  Battles, the horrors of fratricidal war, the fever of doubtful news,\\n      the fitful events;\\n  These come to me days and nights and go from me again,\\n  But they are not the Me myself.\\n\\n  Apart from the pulling and hauling stands what I am,\\n  Stands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle, unitary,\\n  Looks down, is erect, or bends an arm on an impalpable certain rest,\\n  Looking with side-curved head curious what will come next,\\n  Both in and out of the game and watching and wondering at it.\\n\\n  Backward I see in my own days where I sweated through fog with\\n      linguists and contenders,\\n  I have no mockings or arguments, I witness and wait.\\n\\n       5\\n  I believe in you my soul, the other I am must not abase itself to you,\\n  And you must not be abased to the other.\\n\\n  Loafe with me on the grass, loose the stop from your throat,\\n  Not words, not music or rhyme I want, not custom or lecture, not\\n      even the best,\\n  Only the lull I like, the hum of your valved voice.\\n\\n  I mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning,\\n  How you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turnâ€™d over upon me,\\n  And parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and plunged your tongue\\n      to my bare-stript heart,\\n  And reachâ€™d till you felt my beard, and reachâ€™d till you held my feet.\\n\\n  Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass\\n      all the argument of the earth,\\n  And I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own,\\n  And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own,\\n  And that all the men ever born are also my brothers, and the women\\n      my sisters and lovers,\\n  And that a kelson of the creation is love,\\n  And limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields,\\n  And brown ants in the little wells beneath them,\\n  And mossy scabs of the worm fence, heapâ€™d stones, elder, mullein and\\n      poke-weed.\\n\\n       6\\n  A child said What is the grass? fetching it to me with full hands;\\n  How could I answer the child? I do not know what it is any more than he.\\n\\n  I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green\\n      stuff woven.\\n\\n  Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,\\n  A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt,\\n  Bearing the ownerâ€™s name someway in the corners, that we may see\\n      and remark, and say Whose?\\n\\n  Or I guess the grass is itself a child, the produced babe of the vegetation.\\n\\n  Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,\\n  And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones,\\n  Growing among black folks as among white,\\n  Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same, I\\n      receive them the same.\\n\\n  And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.\\n\\n  Tenderly will I use you curling grass,\\n  It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men,\\n  It may be if I had known them I would have loved them,\\n  It may be you are from old people, or from offspring taken soon out\\n      of their mothersâ€™ laps,\\n  And here you are the mothersâ€™ laps.\\n\\n  This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers,\\n  Darker than the colorless beards of old men,\\n  Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.\\n\\n  O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues,\\n  And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths for nothing.\\n\\n  I wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men and women,\\n  And the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring taken\\n      soon out of their laps.\\n\\n  What do you think has become of the young and old men?\\n  And what do you think has become of the women and children?\\n\\n  They are alive and well somewhere,\\n  The smallest sprout shows there is really no death,\\n  And if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait at the\\n      end to arrest it,\\n  And ceasâ€™d the moment life appearâ€™d.\\n\\n  All goes onward and outward, nothing collapses,\\n  And to die is different from what any one supposed, and luckier.\\n\\n       7\\n  Has any one supposed it lucky to be born?\\n  I hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucky to die, and I know it.\\n\\n  I pass death with the dying and birth with the new-washâ€™d babe, and\\n      am not containâ€™d between my hat and boots,\\n  And peruse manifold objects, no two alike and every one good,\\n  The earth good and the stars good, and their adjuncts all good.\\n\\n  I am not an earth nor an adjunct of an earth,\\n  I am the mate and companion of people, all just as immortal and\\n      fathomless as myself,\\n  (They do not know how immortal, but I know.)\\n\\n  Every kind for itself and its own, for me mine male and female,\\n  For me those that have been boys and that love women,\\n  For me the man that is proud and feels how it stings to be slighted,\\n  For me the sweet-heart and the old maid, for me mothers and the\\n      mothers of mothers,\\n  For me lips that have smiled, eyes that have shed tears,\\n  For me children and the begetters of children.\\n\\n  Undrape! you are not guilty to me, nor stale nor discarded,\\n  I see through the broadcloth and gingham whether or no,\\n  And am around, tenacious, acquisitive, tireless, and cannot be shaken away.\\n\\n       8\\n  The little one sleeps in its cradle,\\n  I lift the gauze and look a long time, and silently brush away flies\\n      with my hand.\\n\\n  The youngster and the red-faced girl turn aside up the bushy hill,\\n  I peeringly view them from the top.\\n\\n  The suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bedroom,\\n  I witness the corpse with its dabbled hair, I note where the pistol\\n      has fallen.\\n\\n  The blab of the pave, tires of carts, sluff of boot-soles, talk of\\n      the promenaders,\\n  The heavy omnibus, the driver with his interrogating thumb, the\\n      clank of the shod horses on the granite floor,\\n  The snow-sleighs, clinking, shouted jokes, pelts of snow-balls,\\n  The hurrahs for popular favorites, the fury of rousâ€™d mobs,\\n  The flap of the curtainâ€™d litter, a sick man inside borne to the hospital,\\n  The meeting of enemies, the sudden oath, the blows and fall,\\n  The excited crowd, the policeman with his star quickly working his\\n      passage to the centre of the crowd,\\n  The impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes,\\n  What groans of over-fed or half-starvâ€™d who fall sunstruck or in fits,\\n  What exclamations of women taken suddenly who hurry home and\\n      give birth to babes,\\n  What living and buried speech is always vibrating here, what howls\\n      restrainâ€™d by decorum,\\n  Arrests of criminals, slights, adulterous offers made, acceptances,\\n      rejections with convex lips,\\n  I mind them or the show or resonance of them--I come and I depart.\\n\\n       9\\n  The big doors of the country barn stand open and ready,\\n  The dried grass of the harvest-time loads the slow-drawn wagon,\\n  The clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged,\\n  The armfuls are packâ€™d to the sagging mow.\\n\\n  I am there, I help, I came stretchâ€™d atop of the load,\\n  I felt its soft jolts, one leg reclined on the other,\\n  I jump from the cross-beams and seize the clover and timothy,\\n  And roll head over heels and tangle my hair full of wisps.\\n\\n       10\\n  Alone far in the wilds and mountains I hunt,\\n  Wandering amazed at my own lightness and glee,\\n  In the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night,\\n  Kindling a fire and broiling the fresh-killâ€™d game,\\n  Falling asleep on the gatherâ€™d leaves with my dog and gun by my side.\\n\\n  The Yankee clipper is under her sky-sails, she cuts the sparkle and scud,\\n  My eyes settle the land, I bend at her prow or shout joyously from the deck.\\n\\n  The boatmen and clam-diggers arose early and stopt for me,\\n  I tuckâ€™d my trowser-ends in my boots and went and had a good time;\\n  You should have been with us that day round the chowder-kettle.\\n\\n  I saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far west,\\n      the bride was a red girl,\\n  Her father and his friends sat near cross-legged and dumbly smoking,\\n      they had moccasins to their feet and large thick blankets\\n      hanging from their shoulders,\\n  On a bank lounged the trapper, he was drest mostly in skins, his luxuriant\\n      beard and curls protected his neck, he held his bride by the hand,\\n  She had long eyelashes, her head was bare, her coarse straight locks\\n      descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reachâ€™d to her feet.\\n\\n  The runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside,\\n  I heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile,\\n  Through the swung half-door of the kitchen I saw him limpsy and weak,\\n  And went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured him,\\n  And brought water and fillâ€™d a tub for his sweated body and bruisâ€™d feet,\\n  And gave him a room that enterâ€™d from my own, and gave him some\\n      coarse clean clothes,\\n  And remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness,\\n  And remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles;\\n  He staid with me a week before he was recuperated and passâ€™d north,\\n  I had him sit next me at table, my fire-lock leanâ€™d in the corner.\\n\\n       11\\n  Twenty-eight young men bathe by the shore,\\n  Twenty-eight young men and all so friendly;\\n  Twenty-eight years of womanly life and all so lonesome.\\n\\n  She owns the fine house by the rise of the bank,\\n  She hides handsome and richly drest aft the blinds of the window.\\n\\n  Which of the young men does she like the best?\\n  Ah the homeliest of them is beautiful to her.\\n\\n  Where are you off to, lady? for I see you,\\n  You splash in the water there, yet stay stock still in your room.\\n\\n  Dancing and laughing along the beach came the twenty-ninth bather,\\n  The rest did not see her, but she saw them and loved them.\\n\\n  The beards of the young men glistenâ€™d with wet, it ran from their long hair,\\n  Little streams passâ€™d all over their bodies.\\n\\n  An unseen hand also passâ€™d over their bodies,\\n  It descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs.\\n\\n  The young men float on their backs, their white bellies bulge to the\\n      sun, they do not ask who seizes fast to them,\\n  They do not know who puffs and declines with pendant and bending arch,\\n  They do not think whom they souse with spray.\\n\\n       12\\n  The butcher-boy puts off his killing-clothes, or sharpens his knife\\n      at the stall in the market,\\n  I loiter enjoying his repartee and his shuffle and break-down.\\n\\n  Blacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the anvil,\\n  Each has his main-sledge, they are all out, there is a great heat in\\n      the fire.\\n\\n  From the cinder-strewâ€™d threshold I follow their movements,\\n  The lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their massive arms,\\n  Overhand the hammers swing, overhand so slow, overhand so sure,\\n  They do not hasten, each man hits in his place.\\n\\n       13\\n  The negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses, the block swags\\n      underneath on its tied-over chain,\\n  The negro that drives the long dray of the stone-yard, steady and\\n      tall he stands poisâ€™d on one leg on the string-piece,\\n  His blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast and loosens over\\n      his hip-band,\\n  His glance is calm and commanding, he tosses the slouch of his hat\\n      away from his forehead,\\n  The sun falls on his crispy hair and mustache, falls on the black of\\n      his polishâ€™d and perfect limbs.\\n\\n  I behold the picturesque giant and love him, and I do not stop there,\\n  I go with the team also.\\n\\n  In me the caresser of life wherever moving, backward as well as\\n      forward sluing,\\n  To niches aside and junior bending, not a person or object missing,\\n  Absorbing all to myself and for this song.\\n\\n  Oxen that rattle the yoke and chain or halt in the leafy shade, what\\n      is that you express in your eyes?\\n  It seems to me more than all the print I have read in my life.\\n\\n  My tread scares the wood-drake and wood-duck on my distant and\\n      day-long ramble,\\n  They rise together, they slowly circle around.\\n\\n  I believe in those wingâ€™d purposes,\\n  And acknowledge red, yellow, white, playing within me,\\n  And consider green and violet and the tufted crown intentional,\\n  And do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something else,\\n  And the jay in the woods never studied the gamut, yet trills pretty well to me,\\n  And the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me.\\n\\n       14\\n  The wild gander leads his flock through the cool night,\\n  Ya-honk he says, and sounds it down to me like an invitation,\\n  The pert may suppose it meaningless, but I listening close,\\n  Find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky.\\n\\n  The sharp-hoofâ€™d moose of the north, the cat on the house-sill, the\\n      chickadee, the prairie-dog,\\n  The litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats,\\n  The brood of the turkey-hen and she with her half-spread wings,\\n  I see in them and myself the same old law.\\n\\n  The press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections,\\n  They scorn the best I can do to relate them.\\n\\n  I am enamourâ€™d of growing out-doors,\\n  Of men that live among cattle or taste of the ocean or woods,\\n  Of the builders and steerers of ships and the wielders of axes and\\n      mauls, and the drivers of horses,\\n  I can eat and sleep with them week in and week out.\\n\\n  What is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest, is Me,\\n  Me going in for my chances, spending for vast returns,\\n  Adorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take me,\\n  Not asking the sky to come down to my good will,\\n  Scattering it freely forever.\\n\\n       15\\n  The pure contralto sings in the organ loft,\\n  The carpenter dresses his plank, the

ascend to the foretruck,\\n  I take my place late at night in the crowâ€™s-nest,\\n  We sail the arctic sea, it is plenty light enough,\\n  Through the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the

fancies toward them,\\n  We are approaching some great battle-field in which we are soon to\\n      be engaged,\\n  We pass the colossal outposts of the encampment, we pass with still\\n      feet and caution,\\n  Or we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruinâ€™d city,\\n  The blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living cities\\n      of the globe.\\n\\n  I am a free companion, I bivouac by invading watchfires,\\n  I turn the bridegroom out of bed and stay with the bride myself,\\n  I tighten her all night to my thighs and lips.\\n\\n  My voice is the wifeâ€™s voice, the

skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the\\n      steamship, and Death chasing it up and down the storm,\\n  How he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch, and was faithful of\\n      days and faithful of nights,\\n  And chalkâ€™d in large letters on a board, Be of good cheer, we will\\n      not desert you;\\n  How he followâ€™d with them and tackâ€™d with them three days and\\n      would not give it up,\\n  How he saved the drifting company at last,\\n  How the lank loose-gownâ€™d women lookâ€™d when boated from the\\n      side of their prepared graves,\\n  How the silent old-faced infants and the lifted sick, and the\\n      sharp-lippâ€™d unshaved men;\\n  All this I swallow, it tastes good, I like it well, it becomes mine,\\n  I am the man, I sufferâ€™d, I was there.\\n\\n  The disdain and calmness of martyrs,\\n  The mother of old, condemnâ€™d for a witch, burnt with dry wood, her\\n      children gazing on,\\n  The hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the fence,\\n      blowing, coverâ€™d with sweat,\\n  The twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck, the murderous\\n      buckshot and the bullets,\\n  All these I feel or am.\\n\\n  I am the hounded slave, I wince at the bite of the dogs,\\n  Hell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the marksmen,\\n  I clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinnâ€™d with the\\n      ooze of my skin,\\n  I fall on the weeds and stones,\\n  The riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close,\\n  Taunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with whip-stocks.\\n\\n  Agonies are one of my changes of garments,\\n  I do not ask the wounded person how he feels, I myself become the\\n      wounded person,\\n  My hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and observe.\\n\\n  I am the mashâ€™d fireman with breast-bone broken,\\n  Tumbling walls buried me in their debris,\\n  Heat and smoke I inspired, I heard the yelling shouts of my comrades,\\n  I heard the distant click of their picks and shovels,\\n  They have clearâ€™d the beams away, they tenderly lift me forth.\\n\\n  I lie in the night air in my red shirt, the pervading hush is for my sake,\\n  Painless after all I lie exhausted but not so unhappy,\\n  White and beautiful are the faces around me, the heads are bared\\n      of their fire-caps,\\n  The kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches.\\n\\n  Distant and dead resuscitate,\\n  They show as the dial or move as the hands of me, I am the clock myself.\\n\\n  I am an old artillerist, I tell of my fortâ€™s bombardment,\\n  I am there again.\\n\\n  Again the long roll of the drummers,\\n  Again the attacking cannon, mortars,\\n  Again to my listening ears the cannon responsive.\\n\\n  I take part, I see and hear the whole,\\n  The cries, curses, roar, the plaudits for well-aimâ€™d shots,\\n  The ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip,\\n  Workmen searching after damages, making indispensable repairs,\\n  The fall of grenades through the rent roof, the fan-shaped explosion,\\n  The whizz of limbs, heads, stone, wood, iron, high in the air.\\n\\n  Again gurgles the mouth of my dying general, he furiously waves\\n      with his hand,\\n  He gasps through the clot Mind not me--mind--the entrenchments.\\n\\n       34\\n  Now I tell what I knew in Texas in my early youth,\\n  (I tell not the fall of Alamo,\\n  Not one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo,\\n  The hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo,)\\n  â€™Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelve\\n      young men.\\n\\n  Retreating they had formâ€™d in a hollow square with their baggage for\\n      breastworks,\\n  Nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemies, nine times their\\n      number, was the price they took in advance,\\n  Their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone,\\n  They treated for an honorable capitulation, receivâ€™d writing and\\n      seal, gave up their arms and marchâ€™d back prisoners of war.\\n\\n  They were the glory of the race of rangers,\\n  Matchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship,\\n  Large, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and affectionate,\\n  Bearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters,\\n  Not a single one over thirty years of age.\\n\\n  The second First-day morning they were brought out in squads and\\n      massacred, it was beautiful early summer,\\n  The work commenced about five oâ€™clock and was over by eight.\\n\\n  None obeyâ€™d the command to kneel,\\n  Some made a mad and helpless rush, some stood stark and straight,\\n  A few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart, the living and dead\\n      lay together,\\n  The maimâ€™d and mangled dug in the dirt, the new-comers saw them there,\\n  Some half-killâ€™d attempted to crawl away,\\n  These were despatchâ€™d with bayonets or batterâ€™d with the blunts of muskets,\\n  A youth not seventeen years old seizâ€™d his assassin till two more\\n      came to release him,\\n  The three were all torn and coverâ€™d with the boyâ€™s blood.\\n\\n  At eleven oâ€™clock began the burning of the bodies;\\n  That is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve young men.\\n\\n       35\\n  Would you hear of an old-time sea-fight?\\n  Would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars?\\n  List to the yarn, as my grandmotherâ€™s father the sailor told it to me.\\n\\n  Our foe was no skulk in his ship I tell you, (said he,)\\n  His was the surly English pluck, and there is no tougher or truer,\\n      and never was, and never will be;\\n  Along the lowerâ€™d eve he came horribly raking us.\\n\\n  We closed with him, the yards entangled, the cannon touchâ€™d,\\n  My captain lashâ€™d fast with his own hands.\\n\\n  We had receivâ€™d some eighteen pound shots under the water,\\n  On our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first fire,\\n      killing all around and blowing up overhead.\\n\\n  Fighting at sun-down, fighting at dark,\\n  Ten oâ€™clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the gain,\\n      and five feet of water reported,\\n  The master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the after-hold\\n      to give them a chance for themselves.\\n\\n  The transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels,\\n  They see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust.\\n\\n  Our frigate takes fire,\\n  The other asks if we demand quarter?\\n  If our colors are struck and the fighting done?\\n\\n  Now I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little captain,\\n  We have not struck, he composedly cries, we have just begun our part\\n      of the fighting.\\n\\n  Only three guns are in use,\\n  One is directed by the captain himself against the enemyâ€™s main-mast,\\n  Two well servâ€™d with grape and canister silence his musketry and\\n      clear his decks.\\n\\n  The tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially\\n      the main-top,\\n  They hold out bravely during the whole of the action.\\n\\n  Not a momentâ€™s cease,\\n  The leaks gain fast on the pumps, the fire eats toward the powder-magazine.\\n\\n  One of the pumps has been shot away, it is generally thought we are sinking.\\n\\n  Serene stands the little captain,\\n  He is not hurried, his voice is neither high nor low,\\n  His eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns.\\n\\n  Toward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender to us.\\n\\n       36\\n  Stretchâ€™d and still lies the midnight,\\n  Two great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness,\\n  Our vessel riddled and slowly sinking, preparations to pass to the\\n      one we have conquerâ€™d,\\n  The captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his orders through a\\n      countenance white as a sheet,\\n  Near by the corpse of the child that servâ€™d in the cabin,\\n  The dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully\\n      curlâ€™d whiskers,\\n  The flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and below,\\n  The husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty,\\n  Formless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves, dabs of flesh\\n      upon the masts and spars,\\n  Cut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the soothe of waves,\\n  Black and impassive guns, litter of powder-parcels, strong scent,\\n  A few large stars overhead, silent and mournful shining,\\n  Delicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass and fields by\\n      the shore, death-messages given in charge to survivors,\\n  The hiss of the surgeonâ€™s knife, the gnawing teeth of his saw,\\n  Wheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild scream, and long,\\n      dull, tapering groan,\\n  These so, these irretrievable.\\n\\n       37\\n  You laggards there on guard! look to your arms!\\n  In at the conquerâ€™d doors they crowd! I am possessâ€™d!\\n  Embody all presences outlawâ€™d or suffering,\\n  See myself in prison shaped like another man,\\n  And feel the dull unintermitted pain.\\n\\n  For me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and keep watch,\\n  It is I let out in the morning and barrâ€™d at night.\\n\\n  Not a mutineer walks handcuffâ€™d to jail but I am handcuffâ€™d to him\\n      and walk by his side,\\n  (I am less the jolly one there, and more the silent one with sweat\\n      on my twitching lips.)\\n\\n  Not a youngster is taken for larceny but I go up too, and am tried\\n      and sentenced.\\n\\n  Not a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but I also lie at the last gasp,\\n  My face is ash-colorâ€™d, my sinews gnarl, away from me people retreat.\\n\\n  Askers embody themselves in me and I am embodied in them,\\n  I project my hat, sit shame-faced, and beg.\\n\\n       38\\n  Enough! enough! enough!\\n  Somehow I have been stunnâ€™d. Stand back!\\n  Give me a little time beyond my cuffâ€™d head, slumbers, dreams, gaping,\\n  I discover myself on the verge of a usual mistake.\\n\\n  That I could forget the mockers and insults!\\n  That I could forget the trickling tears and the blows of the\\n      bludgeons and hammers!\\n  That I could look with a separate look on my own crucifixion and\\n      bloody crowning.\\n\\n  I remember now,\\n  I resume the overstaid fraction,\\n  The grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to it, or to any graves,\\n  Corpses rise, gashes heal, fastenings roll from me.\\n\\n  I troop forth replenishâ€™d with supreme power, one of an average\\n      unending procession,\\n  Inland and sea-coast we go, and pass all boundary lines,\\n  Our swift ordinances on their way over the whole earth,\\n  The blossoms we wear in our hats the growth of thousands of years.\\n\\n  Eleves, I salute you! come forward!\\n  Continue your annotations, continue your questionings.\\n\\n       39\\n  The friendly and flowing savage, who is he?\\n  Is he waiting for civilization, or past it and mastering it?\\n\\n  Is he some Southwesterner raisâ€™d out-doors? is he Kanadian?\\n  Is he from the Mississippi country?

40\\n  Flaunt of the sunshine I need not your bask--lie over!\\n  You light surfaces only, I force surfaces and depths also.\\n\\n  Earth! you seem to look for something at my hands,\\n  Say, old top-knot, what do you want?\\n\\n  Man or woman, I might tell how I like you, but cannot,\\n  And might tell what it is in me and what it is in you, but cannot,\\n  And might tell that pining I have, that pulse of my nights and days.\\n\\n  Behold, I do not give lectures or a little charity,\\n  When I give I give myself.\\n\\n  You there, impotent, loose in the knees,\\n  Open your scarfâ€™d chops till I blow grit within you,\\n  Spread your palms and lift the flaps of your pockets,\\n  I am not to be denied, I compel, I have stores plenty and to spare,\\n  And any thing I have I bestow.\\n\\n  I do not ask who you are, that is not important to me,\\n  You can do nothing and be nothing but what I will infold you.\\n\\n  To cotton-field drudge or cleaner of privies I lean,\\n  On his right cheek I put the family kiss,\\n  And in my soul I swear I never will deny him.\\n\\n  On women fit for conception I start bigger and nimbler babes.\\n  (This day I am jetting the stuff of

with tremendous breath, I buoy you up,\\n  Every room of the house do I fill with an armâ€™d force,\\n  Lovers of me, bafflers of graves.\\n\\n  Sleep--I and they keep guard all night,\\n  Not doubt, not decease shall dare to lay finger upon you,\\n  I have embraced you, and henceforth possess you to myself,\\n  And when you rise in the morning you will find what I tell you is so.\\n\\n       41\\n  I am he bringing help for the sick as they pant on their backs,\\n  And for strong upright men I bring yet more needed help.\\n\\n  I heard what was said of the universe,\\n  Heard it and heard

who learns under it to destroy the teacher.\\n\\n  The boy I love, the same becomes a man not through derived power,\\n      but in his own right,\\n  Wicked rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear,\\n  Fond of his sweetheart, relishing well his steak,\\n  Unrequited love or a slight cutting him worse than sharp steel cuts,\\n  First-rate to ride, to fight, to hit the bullâ€™s eye, to sail a\\n      skiff, to sing a song or play on the banjo,\\n  Preferring scars and the beard and faces pitted with small-pox over\\n      all latherers,\\n  And those well-tannâ€™d to those that keep out of the sun.\\n\\n  I teach straying from me, yet who can stray from me?\\n  I follow you whoever you are from the present hour,\\n  My words itch at your ears till you understand them.\\n\\n  I do not say these things for a dollar or to fill up the time while\\n      I wait for a boat,\\n  (It is you talking just as much as myself, I act as the tongue of you,\\n  Tied in your mouth, in mine it begins to be loosenâ€™d.)\\n\\n  I swear I will never again mention love or death inside a house,\\n  And I swear I will never translate myself at all, only to him or her\\n      who privately stays with me in the open air.\\n\\n  If you would understand me go to the heights or water-shore,\\n  The nearest gnat is an explanation, and a drop or motion of waves key,\\n  The maul, the oar, the hand-saw, second my words.\\n\\n  No shutterâ€™d room or school can commune with me,\\n  But roughs and little children better than they.\\n\\n  The young mechanic is closest to me, he knows me well,\\n  The woodman that takes his axe and jug with him shall take me with\\n      him all day,\\n  The farm-boy ploughing in the field feels good at the sound of my voice,\\n  In vessels that sail my words sail, I go with fishermen and seamen\\n      and love them.\\n\\n  The soldier campâ€™d or upon the march is mine,\\n  On the night ere the pending battle many seek me, and I do not fail them,\\n  On that solemn night (it may be their last) those that know me seek me.\\n  My face rubs to the hunterâ€™s face when he lies down alone in his blanket,\\n  The driver thinking of me does not mind the jolt of his wagon,\\n  The young mother and old mother comprehend me,\\n  The girl and the wife rest the needle a moment and forget where they are,\\n  They and all would resume what I have told them.\\n\\n       48\\n  I have said that the soul is not more than the body,\\n  And I have said that the body is not more than the soul,\\n  And nothing, not God, is greater to one than oneâ€™s self is,\\n  And whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own\\n      funeral drest in his shroud,\\n  And I or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of the earth,\\n  And to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod confounds the\\n      learning of all times,\\n  And there is no trade or employment but the young man following it\\n      may become a hero,\\n  And there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheelâ€™d universe,\\n  And I say to any man or woman, Let your soul stand cool and composed\\n      before a million universes.\\n\\n  And I say to mankind, Be not curious about God,\\n  For I who am curious about each am not curious about God,\\n  (No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about God and\\n      about death.)\\n\\n  I hear and behold God in every object, yet understand God not in the least,\\n  Nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than myself.\\n\\n  Why should I wish to see God better than this day?\\n  I see something of God each hour of the twenty-four, and each moment then,\\n  In the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own face in the glass,\\n  I find letters from God dropt in the street, and every one is signâ€™d\\n      by Godâ€™s name,\\n  And I leave them where they are, for I know that wheresoeâ€™er I go,\\n  Others will punctually come for ever and ever.\\n\\n       49\\n  And as to you Death, and you bitter hug of mortality, it is idle to\\n      try to alarm me.\\n\\n  To his work without flinching the accoucheur comes,\\n  I see the elder-hand pressing receiving supporting,\\n  I recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors,\\n  And mark the outlet, and mark the relief and escape.\\n\\n  And as to you Corpse I think you are good manure, but that does not\\n      offend me,\\n  I smell the white roses sweet-scented and growing,\\n  I reach to the leafy lips, I reach to the polishâ€™d breasts of melons.\\n\\n  And as to you Life I reckon you are the leavings of many deaths,\\n  (No doubt I have died myself ten thousand times before.)\\n\\n  I hear you whispering there O stars of heaven,\\n  O suns--O grass of graves--O perpetual transfers and promotions,\\n  If you do not say any thing how can I say any thing?\\n\\n  Of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest,\\n  Of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing twilight,\\n  Toss, sparkles of day and dusk--toss on the black stems that decay\\n      in the muck,\\n  Toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs.\\n\\n  I ascend from the moon, I ascend from the night,\\n  I perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sunbeams reflected,\\n  And debouch to the steady and central from the offspring great or small.\\n\\n       50\\n  There is that in me--I do not know what it is--but I know it is in me.\\n\\n  Wrenchâ€™d and sweaty--calm and cool then my body becomes,\\n  I sleep--I sleep long.\\n\\n  I do not know it--it is without name--it is a word unsaid,\\n  It is not in any dictionary, utterance, symbol.\\n\\n  Something it swings on more than the earth I swing on,\\n  To it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me.\\n\\n  Perhaps I might tell more. Outlines! I plead for my brothers and sisters.\\n\\n  Do you see O my brothers and sisters?\\n  It is not chaos or death--it is form, union, plan--it is eternal\\n      life--it is Happiness.\\n\\n       51\\n  The past and present wilt--I have fillâ€™d them, emptied them.\\n  And proceed to fill my next fold of the future.\\n\\n  Listener up there! what have you to confide to me?\\n  Look in my face while I snuff the sidle of evening,\\n  (Talk honestly, no one else hears you, and I stay only a minute longer.)\\n\\n  Do I contradict myself?\\n  Very well then I contradict myself,\\n  (I am large, I contain multitudes.)\\n\\n  I concentrate toward them that are nigh, I wait on the door-slab.\\n\\n  Who has done his dayâ€™s work? who will soonest be through with his supper?\\n  Who wishes to walk with me?\\n\\n  Will you speak before I am gone? will you prove already too late?\\n\\n       52\\n  The spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me, he complains of my gab\\n      and my loitering.\\n\\n  I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable,\\n  I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.\\n\\n  The last scud of day holds back for me,\\n  It flings my likeness after the rest and true as any on the shadowâ€™d wilds,\\n  It coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk.\\n\\n  I depart as air, I shake my white locks at the runaway sun,\\n  I effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in lacy jags.\\n\\n  I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love,\\n  If you want me again look for me under your boot-soles.\\n\\n  You will hardly know who I am or what I mean,\\n  But I shall be good health to you nevertheless,\\n  And filter and fibre your blood.\\n\\n  Failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged,\\n  Missing me one place search another,\\n  I stop somewhere waiting for you.\\n'"
